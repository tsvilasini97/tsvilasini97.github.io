"I saw the little runt sitting there on a log.
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said "yoda"
Y-O-D-A, Yoda, Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda"

## Inspirational Quotes

> "For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship."
